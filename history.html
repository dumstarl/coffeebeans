            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>Coffee is believed to have originated in Ethiopia, where legend says it was discovered by a goat herder named Kaldi. According to the story, Kaldi noticed that his goats became particularly energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Curious, he tried the berries himself and experienced a newfound alertness. This discovery eventually led to the cultivation of coffee plants and the drink we know today.</p>
